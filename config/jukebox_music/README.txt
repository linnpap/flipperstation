Throw any music you want into either /sounds/ or /secret_sounds/. If it's in /sounds/, it'll be able to be listened to with headphones and an unhacked jukebox.
Anything in /secret_sounds/ can only be heard of a hacked jukebox.

IMPORTANT: Make sure filenames DO NOT have any '.' outside of a file extension, otherwise the song title will be fucked up.
